# Trees

## Why
### Using trees is a way to create a data structure that mimics a "yes/no" decision making process. resource

## What
### "Trees can have any number of children per node, but Binary Trees restrict the number of children to two (hence our left and right children)."

### K-ary Trees: If nodes have more than 2 child nodes, then it is a K-ary Tree.

## Terms

  ### Node: A component that may contain it's own value and references to the other node.
  ### Root: The node at the beginning of the tree
  ### K: The number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. K=2 for a binary tree
  ### Left: Reference to one child node in a binary tree
  ### Right: Reference to the other child node in a binary tree
  ### Edge: The link between a parent and child node
  ### Leaf: A node that does not have any children
  ### Height: The number of edges from root to the furthest leaf.


## How

### Traversals
### **Depth First** Prioritizes going through the height of the tree first. The most common way to traverse through a tree is to use recursion.

 * Pre-order root > left > right
 * In-order left > root > right
 * Post-order left > right >root
 * Pre-order Pre-order

* 1. Root, A, is the output value
* 2. We will then look to the left, B
* 3. Look to the left of that last node which is a leaf, D. D would then get popped off
* 4. We look at the next leaf, E
* 5. Pop off B
* 6. Back to the root of A
* 7. Look at C
* 8. Look to the F
* 9. Pop off F
* 10. Pop off C
* 11. Back to the root of A

**Breadth First** Iterates through the tree going through each level of the tree node by node. Traversal uses a queue.

* 1. Root, A, is in the queue and needs to be dequeued.
* 2. Enqueue left, B, and right, C, child.
* 3. You then dequeue the front nodes (B then C).
* 4. Continue the enqueue and dequeue process on with the leafs
