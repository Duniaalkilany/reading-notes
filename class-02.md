# Html Text

*  HTML elements are used to describe the structure of 
the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
* They also provide semantic information (e.g. where emphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

### how to add markup to the text that appears on your pages : 


 1.  Structural markup: the elements that you can use to 
describe both headings and paragraphs

 2.  Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the meaning of acronyms, and so on .

 ## paragraphs
To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening p tag and closing p tag.






## Bold & Italic
* b :
By enclosing words in the tags (<b>) and </b> we can make 
characters appear bold.The <b> element also represents 
a section of text that would be presented in a visually different way (for example key words in a paragraph) although the use of the <b> element does not imply any additional meaning

* i :
By enclosing words in the tags <i> and </i> we can make 
characters appear italic.The <i> element also represents 
a section of text that would be said in a different way from surrounding content â€” such as technical terms, names of ships, foreign words, thoughts, or other terms that would usually be italicized
