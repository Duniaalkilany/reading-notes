## What is a stack?

* data structure consisting of nodes

* nodes refence next node in stack

* nodes don't reference previous node in stack

 
1- Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed<br>

**Steps**
* Have a node you want to add
* Assign the next property to reference the same node that top is referencing. Top is the node on top of the stack
* The new node is added to the stack but you need to indicate that it is now the first node. Re-assign our reference top to the new node then you're done!

2-Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.<br>

**Steps**
* Create a reference named temp that points to the same node that top points to
* Reassign top to the value of the next node
* Clear out the next property in the temp node then remove it
* Return the value of the temp node that was popped

3-Top - This is the top of the stack. <br>
4-Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.<br>
5-IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.<br>

## stack concept 

* `FILO ` <br>
First In Last Out

This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.

* `LIFO` <br>
Last In First Out 

This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.

assign the next property of Node 5 to reference the same Node that top is referencing: Node 4

re-assign our reference top to the newly added Node, Node 5.

## What is a Queue
Common terminology for a queue is

1-Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue. <br>
2-Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.<br>
3-Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.<br>
4-Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.<br>
5-Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is 6-empty an exception will be raised.<br>
7-IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.<br>

## Queues follow these concepts:

`FIFO`
First In First Out

This means that the first item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue.

`LILO`
Last In Last Out

This means that the last item in the queue will be the last item out of the queue.




### Enqueue

**Steps**
1. Change the next property of the rear node to point to the new node being added. Use rear.next
1. Re-assign the rear reference to point to the new node and you're done.

change the next property of Node 4 to point to the Node we are adding.

re-assign the rear reference to point to Node 5

### Dequeue 

create a temporary reference type named temp and have it point to the same Node that front is pointing too.

re-assign front to the next value that the Node front is referencing

re-assign the next property on the temp Node to null

**Steps**
* Made the front node have a temporary reference of temp.
* Re-assign front to the next node in the queue
* Reassign the next property on the temp node to be null. You have to properly clear unnecessary references
* Return the value of the temp node that was removed
