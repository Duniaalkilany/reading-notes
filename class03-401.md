#  Express REST API

## 1. Name 3 real world use cases where you’d want to change the request with custom middleware

* ### In one scenario you can identify the currently logged in user, so using the custom middleware fetches the user through a set of authentication steps.

* ### A second example is changing the functionality on your response object, such as creating a new header. I could foresee a company doing that to advertise a sale of a product.

* ### Building on the fact that a user logs in, the custom middleware can be uses to also validate a users data. The users information and credentials could be stored in a database to verify the information is correct.

### in other words :
* ### Application level middleware
* ### Built in middleware
* ### Error handling middleware



## 2. True or false: The route handler is middleware?

### True, route handling is a part of middleware functionality. The exception is route handling may invoke the next function parameter to pass control onto the middleware function within the stack.

## 3. In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?
* ### res.send()
* ### res.redirect()
* ### res.render()
* ### res.sendFile()
* ### res.download()

## 4. At what point in the request lifecycle can you “inject” middleware?
### when sending a request or a request parameter by the client side will inject the middleware so Middleware is usually injected during a req and before a response cycle, this means that middleware is a dependency and the req and res cycle depend on the middleware to take place.

## 5. What can cause express to error with “Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response”

### means that you're already in the Body or Finished state, but some function tried to set a header, like callbacks invoked twice for example.

# Document the following Vocabulary Terms

## Middleware: functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), that can Execute any code. Make changes to the request and the response objects.

## Request Object:object represents the HTTP request and has properties for the request query string, parameters, body, HTTP headers, and so on.(req.body)

## Response Object:	The res object represents the HTTP response that an Express app sends when it gets an HTTP request. (rs.status)

## Application Middleware:software that provides common services and capabilities to applications

## Routing Middleware: middleware function that we can define it and invoke globaly by app.use

## Test Driven Development:TDD is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing software again all test cases.

## Behavioral Testing: A type of testing using the external behavior of the program, which is also known as black box testing





# Preview
## Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

### SOAP, TDD, Request Object

## Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
### SOAP and TDD and REST 

## What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?

### I think in general I’m excited just to manipulate code and to make it so I can refactor to a point of clarity that is easy to read and easy to repeat.
