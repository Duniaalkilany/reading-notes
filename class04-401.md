# Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
* ## You can run all the tests to ensure they work
* ## Write the code that is simple and passes a test
* ## Refactor your code

# In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?


## If you have some work you need to do repeatedly for many tests
## beforeEach() can be used before an event takes place so we could initialize a database.
## Followed by afterEach() which could clear out the results in a database.

# What is one downside of Test Driven Development

## It is a slow process and consumes time because there are many steps involved

# Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?

## A big difference between class and prototype-bases inheritance is that a class defines a type which can be instantiated at a runtime, whereas a prototype is itself an object instance. 

# Why REST?

* ## Flexibile
* ## easy to modify and it's also able to answer many clients who can ask for different data types (XML, JSON, and so on).

 # Document the following Vocabulary Terms

 # Term:

 ## functional programming: 
 
 Functional programming (also called FP) is a way of thinking about software construction by creating pure functions, and i think it realated to methmatical thiking for how implement function


 ## object-oriented programming (OOP):
 
 programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data, like creating objects and classas


 ## class:
 
 a template for creating objects, make Sub classing with extends


 ## super: 
 
 keyword is used to access and call functions on an object's parent.


 ## this: 
 
this keyword refers to the object it belongs to.


 ## Test Driven Development (TDD):
 
 software development practice that focuses on creating unit test cases


 ## Jest:
 
  Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.


 ## Continuous Integration (CI):
 
 Continuous Integration is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day.

 
 ## REST:
 
  REpresentational State Transfer


 ## Data Model:
 
  A data model refers to the logical inter-relationships and data flow between different data elements involved in the information world. It also documents the way data is stored and retrieved. ... Data models help represent what data is required and what format is to be used for different business processes

## Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

* ### TDD is becoming clear because it's a great way to ensure you code passes a test before it is pushed up

* ### A WRRC diagram is a great way to visualize a REQ and RES

* ### How module.exports helps with writing code

## Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

* ### How to refactor code
* ### How to efficiently write code
* ### What is a common way to write consistent code

## What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?

### Back end development is more rewarding than i anticipated and i am enjoying the process.
