## How Javascript makes Web pages More interactive !!

 ## 1. ACCESS CONTENT
*** You can use JavaScript to select any element, attribute, or text from an HTML page. For example:***
*  Select the text inside all of the <hl> elements on a page
*  Select any elements that have a c 1 ass attribute with a value of note
*  Find out what was entered into a text input whose id attribute has avalue of ema i

## 2. MODIFY CONTENT
***You can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them. For example:***

* Add a paragraph of text after the first <hl> element
* Change the value of c 1 ass attributes to trigger new CSS rules for those elements
* Change the size or position of an <i mg> element 

## 3. PROGRAM RULES
***You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), which allows it to access or change the
content of a page. For example:***

* A gallery script could check which image a user clicked on and display a larger version of that image.
* A mortgage calculator could collect values from a form, perform a calculation, and display repayments.
* An animation could check the dimensions of the browser window and move an image to the bottom of the viewable area (also known as the viewport).

## 4. 
***REACT TO EVENTS You can specify that a script should run
when a specific event has occurred. For example, it could be run when:***
* A button is pressed
* A link is clicked (or tapped) on
*  A cursor hovers over an element
* Information is added to a form
*  An interval of time has passed
* A web page has finished loading

## What is the script and how can I creat one ?
- **A script is a series of instructions that the computer
can follow in order to achieve a goal.**

- **Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of
all the instructions.**
- **Computers approach tasks in a different way than
humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically.**
- **To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task (a flowchart can help).** 

## EXPRESSIONS:
**An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value.**
**Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions :**

  ** 1.  EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE
In order for a variable **

to be useful, it needs to be given a value. As you have seen, this is done using the assignment operator (the equals sign).
**var color = 'beige';**

When you first declare a variable using the var keyword, it is given a special value of undefined.
This will change when you assign a value to it. Technically,undefined is a data type like a number, string, or Boolean.

** 2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE **
You can perform operations on any number of individual values to determine a single value. 

 **example:**
var area = 3 * 2;
The value of area is now 6.
Here the expression 3 * 2 evaluates into 6. This
example also uses the assignment operator, so the
result of the expression 3 * 2 is stored in the variable
called area.

## OPERATORS 

**Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values **

**1.  ARITHMETI C OPERATORS **
JavaScript contains the following mathematical operators :

**2. STRING OPERATOR**
There is just one string operator: the+ symbol.
It is used to join the strings on either side of it. 


## function 
**WHAT IS A FUNCTION?**
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).

### JavaScript Function Syntax :

**function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  // code to be executed
}**
 
### Calling a function 

**name();**

### Why Functions?
- You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.

- You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.
