# Comparison Operators :
**Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values.**

## the table below explains the comparison operators:

|Operator.|Description|
|---|-----------|
==|[Equal to]
===|[	equal value and equal type]
!=|not equal
!==|not equal value or not equal type
>|	greater than
<|	less than
>=|greater than or equal to
<=|	less than or equal to

## Logical Operators
** Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.**

|Operator.|Description|
|---|-----------|
&&|[and]
ll| [	or]
!|not 

## loops
**Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.**

### Different Kinds of Loops :
**JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:**

* for - loops through a block of code a number of times
* for/in - loops through the properties of an object
* for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
* while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
* do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

### 1. The For Loop
The for loop has the following syntax:

**for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}**

* Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.

* Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.

* Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.

### 2. While Loops

The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

**Syntax
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}**
