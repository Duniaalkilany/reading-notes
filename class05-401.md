# Linked Lists

## Linked list is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The defining feature of a linked list is tat Node references the next Node in the link.

## There are two types of Linked list - Singly and Doubly

* ### Singly: Singly refers to the number of references the node has. A singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the next node.

* ### Doubly: Doubly refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the next and additionally the previous node.

# Traversing

## As you traverse a linked list, you cannot use a forEach or a for loop. We are relying on the Next value to guide the node to the next reference point. A next property is exceptionally important because it will lead us to the next node and allows us to extract data appropriately.

## So what can you use to traverse?? The best approach is to use a while() loop. This will allow us to continually check that the next node is the list is not null.

### **Example**

ALGORITHM Includes (value) // INPUT <-- integer value // OUTPUT <-- boolean

Current <-- Head

WHILE Current is not NULL IF Current.Value is equal to value return TRUE

Current <-- Current.Next
return FALSE

## What took place

### 1. We first create Current at the Head to guarantee we are starting from the beginning.

### 2. We create the while loop and this will only run is the node that Current is pointing too is not null. 

### 3. Once we are in the while loop, we are checking if the value of the current node is equal to the value that we were looking for.

### 4. If the Current node does not contain the value we are looking for, we must move the current to the next node that is being referenced.

### 5.At this point, the while loop is run again and steps 3 & 4 will continue until Current reaches the end of the LinkedList.

## Adding a Node

### Order of operations is extremely important when it comes to working with a Linked list. Each of your links and nodes should be properly assigned.

## Prerequisites
### When constructing your code, keep in mind that a Node class will be passed in to each node that has a value

## **When constructing your code, a few things to keep in mind.**

* ### When making your Node class, consider requiring a value to be passed in to require that each node has a value.

* ### When making a Linked List, you may want to require that at least one node gets passed in upon instantiation. This   first node is what your Head and Current will point too.
