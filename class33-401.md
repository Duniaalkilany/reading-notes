## Review, Research, and Discussion

### Why is the Context API useful?

* #### The React Context API is a way for a React app to effectively produce global variables that can be passed around. This is the alternative to "prop drilling" or moving props from grandparent to child to parent, and so on. Context is also touted as an easier, lighter approach to state management using Redux

### Can a component outside of a provider get its context?

* #### when using global context

### What are some common use cases for using the Context API?

* #### Context is primarily used when some data needs to be accessible by many components at different nesting levels

### Describe “Context Hell”
* #### multiple context provider in class component

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

* #### global state : a global state is a set of local states which are all concurrent with each other. By concurrent, we mean that no two states have a cause and effect relationship with each other.

* #### global context: context that affects the entire application, and it will share data to everything in the React component tree.

* #### provider :Every Context object comes with a Provider React component that allows consuming components to subscribe to context changes. The Provider component accepts a value prop to be passed to consuming components that are descendants of this Provider. One Provider can be connected to many consumers.

* #### consumer : A React component that subscribes to context changes. Using this component lets you subscribe to a context within a function component. Requires a function as a child. The function receives the current context value and returns a React node

## Preparation Materials 

### What is Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)?

* #### DEFINITION OF ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL (RBAC) :

"Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network".

* #### Some of the designations in an RBAC tool can include:
1. Management role scope : it limits what objects the role group is allowed to manage.
2. Management role group : you can add and remove members.
3. Management role : these are the types of tasks that can be performed by a specific role group.
4. Management role assignment : this links a role to a role group.

* #### BENEFITS OF RBAC :
1. Reducing administrative work and IT support
2. Maximizing operational efficiency
3. Improving compliance

#### React-cookies :

* #### "Cookies are the data stored in the form of key-value pairs that are used to store information about the user on their computer by the websites that the users browse and use it to verify them".

* #### To set or remove the cookies, we are using a third-party dependency of react-cookie

* #### Install : npm i react-cookies

* #### "To be able to access user cookies while doing server-rendering, you can use plugToRequest or setRawCookie".
