# HTML5 Layout


 ### Traditional HTML Layouts :
  #### For a long time, web page authors used <div> elements to group together related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a header, an article, footer or sidebar). Authors used class or id attributes to indicate the role of the <div> element in the structure of the page.

###  New Html5 Layout elements :
 #### HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not stopped many web page authors using them already


### 1. Headers & Footers
 #### <header> <footer> 
  

### 2. Navigation
 #### <nav> 

 
### 3. Articales
 #### <article> 

 
### 4. Asides
 #### <Aside>

 
### 5. sections
 #### <section>


### 6. Heading groupd
 #### <hgroup> 


 
### 7. Figures
 #### <figure> <figcaption> 


### 8. Sectioning Elements
 #### <div>


### 9. Linking Around Block-Level Elements
 #### HTML5 allows web page authors to place an <a> element around a block level element that contains child elements. This allows you to turn an entire block into a link.This is not a new element in HTML5, but it was not seen as a correct usage of the <a> element in earlier versions of HTML.
