## **What is node.js?**

### is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications. Node. js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

## **In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?**


### is a JavaScript engine, which means that it executes JavaScript code. Originally, JavaScript was written to be executed by web browsers. ... V8 translates JavaScript code directly into machine code* so that computers can actually understand it, then it executes the translated, or compiled, code

## **What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?**

### Node. js is a JavaScript runtime environment that achieves low latency and high throughput by taking a “non-blocking” approach to serving requests. In other words, Node. js wastes no time or resources on waiting for I/O requests to return.

 ### so runtime in js refers to where your javascript code is executed when you run it. That said, javascript can be executed on google chrome, in which case your javascript runtime is v8, if on mozilla - it is spidermonkey, if IE - then its chakra and if on node, again its v8.

## **What is npm?**

### pm is the package manager for the Node JavaScript platform. It puts modules in place so that node can find them, and manages dependency conflicts intelligently. It is extremely configurable to support a wide variety of use cases. Most commonly, it is used to publish, discover, install, and develop node programs. 

## **What version of node are you running on your machine?**
### v12.22.1

## **What version of npm are you running on your machine?**
### 6.14.12

## **What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?**

### locally with npm install jshint or globally with npm install -g jshint

## **What is node used for?**


###  is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded nature. It's used for traditional web sites and back-end API services, but was designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind.

# **6 Reasons for Pair Programming**

## **What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?**

1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness


## **In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?**

### Learning from fellow students , because Everyone has a different approach to problem solving; working with a teammate can expose developers to techniques they otherwise would not have thought of. If one developer has a unique approach to a specific problem, pair programming exposes the other developer to a new solution.

### Often times, the developers in a pairing have different skill sets. If one programmer is more experienced in a certain skill, they can teach a student who is less familiar with that area. The less experienced developer benefits from the experienced developer’s knowledge and guidance, and the latter benefits from explaining the topic in their own words, further solidifying their own understanding.

## **How does pair programming work?**

### pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.
