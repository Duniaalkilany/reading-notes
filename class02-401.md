## 1. What’s the difference between PUT and PATCH?

* ### PUT and PATCH are HTTP verbs and they both relate to updating a resource. The main difference in PUT and PATCH method is the PUT method uses the request URI to supply a modified version of the requested resource which replaces the original version of the resource. PATCH on the other hand supplies a set of instructions to modify the resource.

## 2. Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server
* ### Mock server https://www.mock-server.com/
* ###  Postman https://www.postman.com/
* ###  Insomnia https://insomnia.rest/

## 3. Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?

### apiDocjs and Swagger Inspector can be primarily classified as "API" tools.
* ### apiDocjs: Inline Documentation for RESTful web APIs. It creates a documentation from API annotations in your source code.
* ### Swagger : Test and Document Your APIs With Ease. It is a free cloud-based API testing and documentation tool to simplify the validation of any API and generate its corresponding OpenAPI documentation.

* ### 404 Not found
* ###  403 Request is forbidden
* ### 500 Internal Server Error

## 4. Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST

* ### SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol whereas REST stands for Representational State Transfer
* ### SOAP is a protocol whereas REST is an architectural pattern
* ### SOAP only works with XML formats whereas REST works with plain text, XML, HMTL and JSON. 
* ### SOAP is a standardized protocol that sends messages using other protocols such as HTTP
* ### REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It’s an architectural style that defines a set of recommendations for designing loosely coupled applications that use the HTTP protocol for data transmission. REST doesn’t prescribe how to implement the principles at a lower level.

## Routing: The process of selecting a path for traffic in a network or between or across multiple networks.

## WRRC: Web Request Response Cycle

# Preview

## Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
* ### What the WRRC does and how a backend developer interacts with the WRRC
* ### How a callback is used to chain multiple functions together
* ### There are a lot of similarities to how API's are written with app.get

## Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
* ### it would be great to learn more about the middleware and how that interacts with WRRC
* ### How compartmentalizing your code makes you a better Software Developer
* ### How CI CD is a beneficial role to the Software Developer but also the WRRC

## What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
### I am most excited for being able to work with a programing language like react and incorporating that into my JavaScript.
