# AWS: S3 and Lambda


# Review, Research, and Discussion

## Describe “The Cloud”
### The cloud refers to servers accessed over the internet that store resources and software for computing and data storage.

## What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?
### A container is like a bundle containing an application and everything it needs to run.

## What is auto-scaling?
### A cloud computing feature that allows cloud services to automatically scale based on traffic and utilization.

## What is bandwidth?
### Bandwidth is how much data can be transferred by an entity such as a network or hardware.

## How do cloud providers compute service costs?
### They charge based on the amount of usage of their services.

# Document the following Vocabulary Terms

## Server Instances
### A single instance of a server when it is run on a machine or virtual machine

## Containers
### A self contained environment that contains an application and all of its dependencies.

## Cloud Services
### Services provided by a cloud service provider such as computing resources and data storage.

## Cloud Architecture
### All of the cloud services used in a project such as databases and computing resources.

## AWS
### Amazon Web Services - a major cloud service provider

## EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku
### EC2/Beanstalk is AWS's infrastructure solution for deploying software. Heroku is built off of these services and is more user friendly in my opinion.

# Preparation Materials 

## AWS S3 :

### "Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. This means customers of all sizes and industries can use it to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as data lakes, websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, enterprise applications, IoT devices, and big data analytics. Amazon S3 provides easy-to-use management features so you can organize your data and configure finely-tuned access controls to meet your specific business, organizational, and compliance requirements".


## AWS Lambda :

### "serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Users of AWS Lambda create functions, self-contained applications written in one of the supported languages and runtimes, and upload them to AWS Lambda, which executes those functions in an efficient and flexible manner".

## To complete a Serverless stack we need:

* ### a computing service;
* ### a database service; and
* ### an HTTP gateway service.


## AWS Lambda Functions :

### No servers to manage :AWS Lambda automatically runs your code without requiring you to provision or manage infrastructure.

### Continuous scaling :AWS Lambda automatically scales your application by running code in response to each event.

### Cost optimized with millisecond metering :With AWS Lambda, you only pay for the compute time you consume, so you’re never paying for over-provisioned infrastructure.

### Consistent performance at any scale :With AWS Lambda, you can optimize your code execution time by choosing the right memory size for your function.

## CDN :

### Content Delivery Network : "is a geographically distributed group of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content. A CDN allows for the fast transfer of data needed for loading Internet content including HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images, and videos".

## Benifites:

* ### Brings consistently great web and video experiences to users anywhere
* ### Provides privacy and data security
* ### Activates with a single click for Cloud Load Balancing users
