# Component Based UI

# Review, Research, and Discussion

## Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)

### Ext JS by Sencha.
### Angular.
### Vue.
### Ember.
### Svelte 3.

## What’s the difference between a framework and a library?

### The technical difference between a framework and library lies in a term called inversion of control. When you use a library, you are in charge of the application flow. You choose when and where to call the library. When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. It provides you with a few places to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed. Framework is often more restrictive and generally have a more set of rules.Whereas, Library is not bounded by many rules.

# Document the following Vocabulary Terms

## Rendering : the process of displaying something on a screen.

## Templates : a generic class or other unit of source code that can be used as the basis for unique units of code

## State : an object of a set of observable properties that control the behavior of the component


# Preparation Materials

## React :

### "React is a JavaScript library, declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

## JSX :

### "JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is simply a syntax extension of JavaScript. It allows us to directly write HTML in React (within JavaScript code). It is easy to create a template using JSX in React, but it is not a simple template language instead it comes with the full power of JavaScript".

## Rendering Elements:

* ### An element describes what you want to see on the screen.

* ### Applications built with just React usually have a single root DOM node. If you are integrating React into an existing app, you may have as many isolated root DOM nodes as you like.

* ### "React elements are immutable. Once you create an element, you can’t change its children or attributes. An element is like a single frame in a movie: it represents the UI at a certain point in time".

* ### "React DOM compares the element and its children to the previous one, and only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state".
