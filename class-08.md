 # **CSS Layout**
 ![layout](https://i.stack.imgur.com/dxkB7.gif)

 * ## < div> elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.

* ## Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.

* ## The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)

* ## Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.

* ## Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).

* ## Grids help create professional and flexible designs.

* ## CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.

* ## You can include multiple CSS files in one page

## **HTML Layout Techniques**

**There are four different techniques to create multicolumn layouts. Each technique has its pros and cons:**

### **1. CSS framework**
### **2. CSS float property**
### **3. CSS flexbox**
### **4. CSS grid**


## **CSS Frameworks**

If you want to create your layout fast, you can use a CSS framework, like W3.CSS or Bootstrap.

## **CSS Float Layout**

It is common to do entire web layouts using the CSS float property. Float is easy to learn - you just need to remember how the float and clear properties work. Disadvantages: Floating elements are tied to the document flow, which may harm the flexibility

## **CSS Flexbox Layout**
Use of flexbox ensures that elements behave predictably when the page layout must accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices.

## **CSS Grid Layout**

The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.
