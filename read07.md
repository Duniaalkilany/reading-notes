## Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.


## There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:

1. RGB values
2. hex codes 
3. color names

## Color pickers can help you find the color you want.

## It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).


## CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors toindicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.

## CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values,with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.
